# ChatWithPDF

ChatWithPDF is a project that allows users to interact with PDF documents using natural language queries. This project leverages the Gemini large language models and the `models/embedding-001` model to provide accurate and contextual responses based on the content of the PDFs.



## Features

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Users can ask questions in natural language and receive relevant responses based on the content of the PDF.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The model understands the context of the questions and provides accurate answers.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and integration with existing systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Gemini Large Language Models**: Used for natural language processing and understanding.
- **Model `models/embedding-001`**: Specific model used for embedding and contextual understanding.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for the project.
